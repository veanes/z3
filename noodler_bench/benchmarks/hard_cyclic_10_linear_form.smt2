;; Constraint: x "A" x \in R
;; The letter "A" is neither in [a-z] nor [0-9].
;; This forces the engine to push the unwinding of `x` forwards structurally until it hits the character "A".
;; If `x` unwinds infinitely, it diverges. But because `[a-z]*` and `[0-9]` are symbolic classes,
;; the solver must compute SCCs over the ITE-term evaluations of the symbolic derivatives.
;; It should identify the cyclic repetition of `az-star d09`, extract the stabilizer, decompose `x`,
;; and ultimately crash headfirst into the incompatible "A" character, correctly deducing UNSAT.
