;; Constraint: x "b" x \in R
;; A deliberate test for Section 4.2.4: Cycle Subsumption Step.
;; Since x \in (aa)* and (aa)* is a left stabilizer of R (because taking any word from (aa)* and quotienting R leaves R unchanged),
;; the leading variable `x` physically drops out of `x "b" x \in R` via the Subsumption rule.
;; This leaves `"b" x \in R`. 
;; Taking the derivative with respect to "b" cleanly leaves `x \in (aa)*`.
;; A naive tool will endlessly unroll `x \mapsto a x'` -> `x \mapsto a a x''` searching for the "b".
;; But Subsumption cuts the knot instantly.
